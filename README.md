# NBA All Star Prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model to forecast the NBA All-Star selections for the 2023-2024 season, based on player performance data from the previous season. The goal is to identify patterns in individual and team performance metrics that contribute to All-Star selection. This project will provide hands-on experience in data science by utilizing Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and various machine learning models.

### Project Objectives
Use player data from the 2020-2023 NBA seasons to predict All-Star selections for the 2023-2024 season.
Explore the impact of individual statistics and team performance on All-Star selection.
Train and evaluate machine learning models to provide accurate predictions.
Deploy the final project and document it via GitHub.
